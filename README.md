*scPCA is a young project and breaking changes are to be expected.*

## scPCA in a nutshell

scPCA enables the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data across condtions. In simple words, it enables the incorporation of a design (model) matrix that encodes the experimental design of the dataset and infers how the gene loading weight vectors change from a specified reference condition to the treated condtion.

## Quick install

scPCA makes use `torch`, `pyro` and `anndata`. We highly recommend to run scPCA on a GPU device.

### Via Pypi

The easiest option to install `scpca` is via Pypi. Simply type

```
$ pip install scpca
```


into your shell and hit enter.
